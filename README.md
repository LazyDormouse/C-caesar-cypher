# C-caesar-cypher
Implementation of the famous Caesar's cypher as a CLI tool 

For now only message decryption is supported, but encryption will eventually come.

Usage: 

    ccypher string_to_decrypt key
'key' is the number of letters that needs to be left shifted


Example: 

    ccypher "rovvy gybvn" 10
Output is:

    hello world
